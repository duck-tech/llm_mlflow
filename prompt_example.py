Based on the provided pin and power domain information, generate design validation rules to ensure proper isolation control and reliable power domain management.
Consider situations when isolation attributes (isolated and isolated_enable) are used, and specify appropriate conditions for power domain relationships between pins and their associated power sources.
Please clearly state each rule and briefly explain its physical reasoning.

Each rule must follow this format:
Rule N: [Short and clear condition in natural language]
Example: [A minimal JSON-style snippet to illustrate this rule]
